The decline of manufacturing-based employment is an often-discussed topic in American politics, and a major part of the American economic narrative. The 2008 economic recession and accompanying job losses is another recent driver of American moods and discussions about the economy. With this project, I was interested in discovering whether there was a relationship between these two trends. To learn more, I retrieved monthly underemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics covering the years 2007-2009 at a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level. I also retrieved data on employment distribution by industry from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

I used these two datasets to determine the change in unemployment from 2007 (pre-recession) to 2009 (mid-recession) as well as the proportion of jobs in manufacturing in 2007 in each MSA. Once I had this data cleaned and merged, I regressed unemployment change against manufacturing percentage. I found a coefficient of 0.07, indicating that MSAs with 1% more jobs in manufacturing were expected to have a 0.07% larger increase in unemployment. This means that, for example, MSAs with 20% of their jobs in manufacturing would be expected to see a 1.4% larger increase in unemployment between 2007 and 2009 than MSAs with no jobs in manufacturing. The p-value of the regression was less than 0.001, indicating that the result is highly statistically significant.

Though this result indicates a definitive correlation between percentage of jobs in manufacturing and change in unemployment, it does not prove a causative link. Further analysis would be required to determine whether the manufacturing sector was hardest-hit by job loss, directly triggering this result. It is also possible that regions that saw high unemployment increases and regions with high percentages of jobs in manufacturing share other, potentially confounding, characteristics, such as population density. However, the knowledge that there was a link between jobs in the manufacturing industry and unemployment increases in the 2008 recession could better equip policymakers seeking to blunt the fallout of future economic downturns.
